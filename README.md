# Cloud-Cafe-Order-Stream
Continuation of the Cloud Cafe, working on developing more cloud skills

Cloud Cafe Order Stream is a next-generation backend system for the Cloud Cafe web application, demonstrating advanced Azure cloud engineering and DevOps practices. This project implements a robust, serverless order processing pipeline featuring asynchronous communication, persistent data storage, and end-to-end automation. It showcases the integration of Azure Functions for event-driven processing, Azure Storage Queues for resilient message queuing, and Azure SQL Database for relational data persistence. Infrastructure is entirely managed as code using Terraform, while application and infrastructure deployments are automated through comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines. Key security principles are applied via Azure Managed Identities and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for secure service-to-service communication. This project serves as a comprehensive portfolio piece for building scalable, secure, and automated cloud-native solutions.
